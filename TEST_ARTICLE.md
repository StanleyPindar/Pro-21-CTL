## Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
  return true;
}
```

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)
```

## Tables

| Feature | Status | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tables | ✅ Complete | High |
| Code Blocks | ✅ Complete | High |
| Callouts | ✅ Complete | Medium |
| Images | ✅ Complete | High |

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |

## Mixed Content

You can combine **bold** with [links](https://example.com) and `code` in the same sentence.

The enhanced parser handles all of this beautifully with proper styling and formatting.
